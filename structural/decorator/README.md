# Intent

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative
to subclassing for extending functionality

# Applicability

* To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically.
* For responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
* When extension by subclassing is impractical (Large number of possible subclasses).
